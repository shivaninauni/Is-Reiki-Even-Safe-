# Is-Reiki-Even-Safe

As per Robert Graham, MD, who is a Harvard-trained and board-certified doctor of integrative medicine, who manages an integrative clinic called Freshmed, Reiki is effective and safe, possibly even beneficial as when it's used as a complement to a medicine not as an alternative. There are a lot of institutions for the same. But there is one <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/reikicolumbusohio/home">reiki healing columbus ohio</a> that is highly recommended.

It's a significant distinction, according to the doctor. Graham: "What people don't understand sometimes is that there is a big difference between those two types of medicine," Dr. Graham describes. Alternative medicine refers to the practice of avoiding Western medical treatments to pursue something completely different, while complementary medicine means that you are practicing a different type or method of treatment in conjunction with traditional medical practices. When you use Reiki as a complementary therapy you can definitely be an advantage or, at the very minimum and not lose, Graham explains.

"When it comes to complementary medicines, it all comes down to a risk-benefit ratio," the doctor states. "If benefits outweigh risk, then it's time to play. If the risk is greater than the benefits, it's time to go."

According To Dr. Graham, Reiki falls under the umbrella of game-on. "From a safety point of view, Reiki hasn't been shown to have any harmful effects," Dr. Graham explains. "And I do believe that there is an untapped mechanism behind energy that supports your own body's healing abilities that we don't understand just yet--so it's certainly worth a trial if you're in pain."
